## 🔧 CURRENT ISSUES TO FIX

### High Priority Bugs
1. **Letter Sending Issue** 🟡 IN PROGRESS
   - Fixed API URL mismatch (localhost:3000 → localhost:5000)
   - Added debugging to sendRandomMatchLetter function
   - Need to test complete flow from frontend to backend

2. **Authentication Token Management** 🔴 NEEDS ATTENTION
   - Inconsistent token storage between login methods
   - Need to standardize token handling across the app

3. **Profile Completion Flow** 🔴 NEEDS ATTENTION
   - Backend requires completed profile for letter sending
   - Frontend doesn't guide users through profile completion

### Technical Debt
- Duplicate API service files (`/lib/api.ts` vs `/services/api.ts`)
- Missing error handling in several components
- Inconsistent API response formats
- No proper loading states in UI components
